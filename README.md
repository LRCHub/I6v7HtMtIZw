[00:03.80] Slow down with the greatness, gotta take time
[00:05.33] Poles out on a bait ting on a date night
[00:07.06] They try imitate mine, that's a hate crime
[00:08.86] Bro's in the can throwin' hands, that's a cage fight
[00:10.89] Big crib and the gate's high, got the K9
[00:12.72] ZK, knife sit right at the waistline
[00:14.48] Heard through the grape vine, it don't make wine
[00:16.08] They hope and they pray I don't stay high
[00:36.58] 
[00:18.26] I changed when I got famous, I'll explain it
[00:20.34] My fam hatin', they say that I got favourites
[00:22.03] Paid, but I got payments upon payments
[00:23.85] I'm in pain, but I'm not blamin', I'm just sayin'
[00:25.98] And my bro's bloodthirsty, he's got cravings
[00:27.65] If he lean out the window, he's not aimin'
[00:29.59] 'Member hearin' a door knock and it's bailiffs
[00:31.48] Now it's acres, I ain't even got neighbours (yeah)
[00:56.48] 
[00:33.43] 40 thousand square feet off of this pain
[00:35.47] Look at me, I got heart acres
[00:37.01] He don't know what heartache is
[00:38.98] I can't ask no one for a teaspoon of sugar, it's tough, got no neighbours
[00:42.69] My uncles had no papers
[00:44.12] We sold sweets in school, made sense that the mandem grew up and sold flavours
[00:48.17] Wanted a million so much, went to the perfume store, bought Paco Rabanne
[00:51.81] TSG had me in the back of the van and prang
[00:54.26] Wanna book a flight, Japan
[00:55.95] I'm on the private jet and the pilot's tellin' me jokes, sellin' me land
[01:31.95] 
[00:59.86] I'm drivin' on a ban, true say, I got disqualifications
[01:03.28] Askin' God, why bless me? I'm a sinner, why bless me when I've sinned?
[01:06.78] I don't care if the next man lose, I just wanna see us man win
[01:09.95] Business class is free, so my mum takes every snack and every drink
[01:13.87] For the times that we struggled and we never had
[01:15.68] I get on my-, I'm tellin' 'em
[01:30.18] 
[01:17.19] Slow down with the greatness, gotta take time
[01:19.34] Poles out on a bait ting on a date night
[01:21.14] They try imitate mine, that's a hate crime
[01:23.09] Bro's in the can throwin' hands, that's a cage fight
[01:24.97] Big crib and the gate's high, got the K9
[01:26.63] ZK, knife sit right at the waistline
[01:28.68] Heard through the grape vine, it don't make wine
[01:30.43] They hope and they pray I don't stay high
[01:50.93] 
[01:32.16] I changed when I got famous, I'll explain it
[01:33.90] My fam hatin', they say that I got favourites
[01:35.87] Paid, but I got payments upon payments
[01:37.63] I'm in pain, but I'm not blamin', I'm just sayin'

[01:45.39] Now it's acres, I ain't even got neighbours
[02:06.89] 
[01:47.33] You know that you're rich when you get a new crib
[01:49.12] But it don't have a number, shit's got a name
[01:51.17] My white ting said she only listen to house
[01:52.72] But she listen to rap if it's Cenral or Dave
[01:54.74] 25 and I'm sittin' on 25 M
[01:56.34] Mummy ain't gotta stress, now the rent get paid
[01:58.23] And they wonder why they ain't gettin' blessed same way
[02:00.19] 'Cause they ain't on takin' the risk that we
[02:01.99] Practice makes perfect, and I'm scratchin' the surface, expandin'
[02:34.49] 
[02:04.70] I was sofa surfin', no mattress
[02:06.57] And I slept in the trap, smelled like cat piss
[02:08.37] Now I'm with a Scarlett Johansson
[02:10.34] A-list actress said I'm so handsome
[02:12.05] When I wanted a 'fit, I would go Camden
[02:14.04] Now it's Rodeo Drive, let's go Lanvin
[02:32.54] 
[02:15.93] Nobody else from London's gone Hollywood, just Cee or the boy Damson
[02:19.57] 20 bags for the sofa and one lamp
[02:21.28] And I got marble floors, I ain't got damp any more
[02:23.51] Tom Ford fragrance well pampered
[02:25.15] I'm a passport full, so they can't stamp it
[02:26.90] In Dubai and I'm stayin' in Atlantis
[02:28.97] I ain't snapped it once 'cause I'm not gassed
[02:51.47] 
[02:30.66] I'm front row at the fashion show, tryna see which model that I wanna fuck next
[02:34.37] She watchin' her weight 'cause she doin' campaigns
[02:36.27] Tell her, "Ride this dick", she ain't done enough steps
[02:37.94] I see those guys from other side
[02:39.80] On a keto diet, 'cause they don't get bread
[02:41.84] Money don't buy happiness 'cause I'm upset
[02:43.50] The more money that you get, make you give a fuck less
[03:10.50] 
[02:45.72] Slow down with the greatness, gotta take time
[02:48.73] Poles out on a bait ting on a date night

[02:51.84] Bro's in the can throwin' hands, that's a cage fight
[02:53.81] Big crib and the gate's high, got the K9
[02:55.76] ZK, knife sit right at the waistline
[02:57.48] Heard through the grape vine, it don't make wine
